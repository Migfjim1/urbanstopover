# Urban Stopover Analysis Using NEXRAD

This is the working repository for my dissertation chapter, which uses NEXRAD data to quantify migratory bird stopover density across the biggest cities in the continental U.S. All code was adapted from Maria Belotti's analysis on Atlanta Georgia, which can be found at: https://gitlab.com/mariabelotti/prjct_georgia_on_my_mind

This repository hosts the workflow used to carry out the spatial analysis, from data retrieval to producing the final dataset that is hosted (here). Below are further details on the repository structure, how to use the code base, and data sources.

Forward any questions regarding this project and code base to Mikko Jimenez (miguel.jimenez@colostate.edu)
