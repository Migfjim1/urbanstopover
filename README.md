# Urban Stopover Analysis Using NEXRAD

This is the working repository for my dissertation chapter, which uses NEXRAD data to quantify migratory bird stopover density across the biggest cities in the continental U.S. 

This repository hosts the workflow used to carry out the spatial analysis, from data retrieval to producing the final dataset that is hosted (here). Below are further details on the repository structure, how to use the code base, and data sources.

Forward any questions regarding this project and code base to Mikko Jimenez (miguel.jimenez@colostate.edu)
